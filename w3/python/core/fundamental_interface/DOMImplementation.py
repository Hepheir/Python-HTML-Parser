    """Interface DOMImplementation

    The `DOMImplementation` interface provides a number of methods for performing operations that are independent of any particular instance of the document object model.

    The DOM Level 1 does not specify a way of creating a document instance, and hence document creation is an operation specific to an implementation. Future Levels of the DOM specification are expected to provide methods for creating documents directly.
