class Node:
    """Interface `Node`

    The `Node` interface is the primary datatype for the entire Document Object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree. While all objects implementing the `Node` interface expose methods for dealing with children, not all objects implementing the `Node` interface may have children. For example, `Text` nodes may not have children, and adding children to such nodes results in a `DOMException` being raised.
    The attributes `node_name`, `node_value` and attributes are included as a mechanism to get at node information without casting down to the specific derived interface. In cases where there is no obvious mapping of these attributes for a specific `node_type` (e.g., `node_value` for an Element or `attributes` for a Comment), this returns `None`. Note that the specialized interfaces may contain additional and more convenient mechanisms to get and set the relevant information.

    Attributes:
        node_name: The name of this node, depending on its type.
        node_value: The value of this node, depending on its type.
        node_type: A code representing the type of the underlying object.
        parent_node: The parent of this node.
        child_nodes: A `NodeList` that contains all children of this node.
        first_child: The first child of this node.
        last_child: The last child of this node.
        previous_sibling: The node immediately preceding this node.
        next_sibling: The node immediately following this node.
        attributes: A `NamedNodeMap` containing the attributes of this node.
        owner_document: The `Document` object associated with this node.
